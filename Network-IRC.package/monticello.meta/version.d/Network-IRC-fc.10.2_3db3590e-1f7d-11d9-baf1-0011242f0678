(name 'Network-IRC-fc.10.2'message 'If the directory structure IRCe creates during class initilization is removed IRC produces a walkback the next time it is run. This fix makes IRCe check and if necessary re-create the directory stucture.This also fixes the problem seen when IRCe is included in the Full image release. Class side initilization is not done in this case! so the directory structure is never created.'id '3db3590e-1f7d-11d9-baf1-0011242f0678'date '16 October 2004'time '10:11:15 am'author 'fc'ancestors ((id 'ef9ac2bb-eff5-11d8-86b9-000a95ad00f6'))stepChildren ())
